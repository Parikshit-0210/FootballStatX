# FootballStatX : International Football Results Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes football match data using R to explore team performance, match statistics, and trends over time. The dataset includes match results from different teams and tournaments, enabling insights into winning patterns, goal distributions, and historical trends.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of **47,599 football matches** (from 1872 to 2024) and includes the following columns:

- **Date**: The date of the match.
- **Home Team**: The team playing at home.
- **Away Team**: The visiting team.
- **Home Score**: Goals scored by the home team.
- **Away Score**: Goals scored by the away team.
- **Tournament**: The type of tournament (e.g., Friendly, World Cup, etc.).
- **City**: The city where the match was played.
- **Country**: The country where the match took place.
- **Neutral**: Whether the match was played at a neutral venue (True/False).
